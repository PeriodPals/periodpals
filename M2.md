# Milestone M2: Team Feedback

This milestone M2 provides an opportunity to give you, as a team, formal feedback on how you are performing in the project. By now, you should be building upon the foundations set in M1, achieving greater autonomy and collaboration within the team. This is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches given during the weekly meetings or asynchronously on Discord, email, etc.

The feedback focuses on two major themes:
First, whether you have adopted good software engineering practices and are making progress toward delivering value to your users.
Is your design and implementation of high quality, easy to maintain, and well tested?
Second, we look at how well you are functioning as a team, how you organize yourselves, and how well you have refined your collaborative development.
An important component is also how much you have progressed, as a team, since the previous milestone.
You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M2 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M2.md) document.
As mentioned in the past, the standards for M2 are elevated relative to M1, and this progression will continue into M3.

We looked at several aspects, grouped as follows:

 - Design
   - [Features](#design-features)
   - [Design Documentation](#design-documentation)
 - [Implementation and Delivery](#implementation-and-delivery)
 - Scrum
   - [Backlogs Maintenance](#scrum-backlogs-maintenance)
   - [Documentation and Ceremonies](#scrum-documentation-and-ceremonies)
   - [Continuous Delivery of Value](#scrum-continuous-delivery-of-value)

## Design: Features

We interacted with your app from a user perspective, assessing each implemented feature and flagging any issues encountered. Our evaluation focused mainly on essential features implemented during Sprints 3, 4, and 5; any additional features planned for future Sprints were not considered in this assessment unless they induced buggy behavior in the current APK.
We examined the completeness of each feature in the current version of the app, and how well it aligns with user needs and the overall project goals.


The features you planned are great. However, at the end of this milestone, your core feature still seems to be needing a good amount of changes. Most of the screens contains very few interactive elements and have placeholders, or otherwise have a few bugs (like previously mentioned). It will take you some work to improve the user experience so that your app is cnvenient for people that need help. But we are confident that in the last milestone you will be able to correct that and finish the core functioning of the app and have all the screens ready.


For this part, you received 5.7 points out of a maximum of 8.0.

## Design: Documentation

We reviewed your Figma (including wireframes and mockups) and the evolution of your overall design architecture in the three Sprints.
We assessed how you leveraged Figma to reason about the UX, ensure a good UX, and facilitate fast UI development.
We evaluated whether your Figma and architecture diagram accurately reflect the current implementation of the app and how well they align with the app's functionality and structure.


Great Figma! It is again complete and interactive! Keep going this way!

The architecture diagram is really clear with your labels. It enables to understand at a glance the structure of your app backend. There might be a change that you will need to perform with the timer, but otherwise it seems to be pretty robust.


For this part, you received 5.7 points out of a maximum of 6.0.

## Implementation and Delivery

We evaluated several aspects of your app's implementation, including code quality, testing, CI practices, and the functionality and quality of the APK.
We assessed whether your code is well modularized, readable, and maintainable.
We looked at the efficiency and effectiveness of your unit and end-to-end tests, and at the line coverage they achieve.


Your code follows the good practices and you are quite willing to respect the MVVM architecture. Your code is also clean and well commented. Keep up that way! You will still need to bring some small improvements but that has not a huge impact.

Regarding your tests, we saw that you had approximately 93% of coverage, but the CI seems to not pass for the last commit of the milestone. Try to make sure that it is always the case before the deadline.

Finally, your app works well. We noticed a few minor bugs: when creating an alert, it did not display in my alerts. When I quit the app, I need to sign in again every time. There also is no limit in the inputs. But otherwise we are curious to see what will be the final result.


For this part, you received 10.8 points out of a maximum of 16.0.

## Scrum: Backlogs Maintenance

We looked at whether your Scrum board is up-to-date and well organized.
We evaluated your capability to organize Sprint 6 and whether you provided a clear overview of this planning on the Scrum board.
We assessed the quality of your user stories and epics: are they clearly defined, are they aligned with a user-centric view of the app, and do they suitably guide you in delivering the highest value possible.


Your boards have been carefully filled up, you also have a category for tasks that where pushed back to a future sprint. It is a good strategy for long term planning, though you need to make sure that you do not forget any of these tasks in the sprint planning.

The product backlog is good, and contains features that could take up at least the rest of the semester. This gives a good direction for your future developments.


For this part, you received 4 points out of a maximum of 4.0.

## Scrum: Documentation and Ceremonies

We assessed how you used the Scrum process to organize yourselves efficiently.
We looked at how well you documented your team Retrospective and Stand-Up during each Sprint.
We also evaluated your autonomy in using Scrum.


During each meeting, it is a great pleasure to see that you consistently filled the documents in advance, allowing the meeting to smoothly go on. The meetings are constructive and we are able to discuss your interrogations. You could maybe try to include more your teammates that are less talkative to make sure we have everyone's opinion. We would now like you to be more autonomous in the conduct of the meeting, letting you lead the review, retrospective and planning discussion, asking proactively questions when you feel it is necessary.


For this part, you received 3.7 points out of a maximum of 4.0.

## Scrum: Continuous Delivery of Value

We evaluated the Increment you delivered at the end of each Sprint, assessing your teamâ€™s ability to continuously add value to the app.
This included an assessment of whether the way you organized the Sprints was conducive to an optimal balance between effort invested and delivery of value.


During some weeks, you seem to be blocked by some tasks that prevented you from delivering what you expected. We know that the middle of the semester was hard with all your problems and deadlines, but we are confident that you can be more proficient in finishing new features each sprint.


For this part, you received 1.2 points out of a maximum of 2.0.

## Summary

Based on the above points, your intermediate grade for this milestone M2 is 4.89. If you are interested in how this fits into the bigger grading scheme, please see the [project README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/README.md) and the [course README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/README.md).

Your coaches will be happy to discuss the above feedback in more detail.

Good luck for the next Sprints!
