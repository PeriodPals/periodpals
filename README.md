These new community features constitute a key innovation: users can discreetly request menstrual products from nearby users through geolocation-based notifications, ensuring privacy and encouraging real-time support. This feature not only helps users in need but also fosters a supportive community, making our app a comprehensive solution for menstrual health management.
